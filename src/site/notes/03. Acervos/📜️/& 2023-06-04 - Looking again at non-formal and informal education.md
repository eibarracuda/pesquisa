- <mark class="hltr-green">"The Assembly recognises that formal educational systems alone cannot respond to the challenges of modern society and therefore welcomes its reinforcement by non-formal educational practices." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 2.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"The Assembly recommends that governments and appropriate authorities of member states recognise non-formal education as a de facto partner in the lifelong process and make it accessible for all (Coun Eur 2000)." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 2.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Defining non-formal education" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 2.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Defining non-formal education" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 2.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"It arose in the context of the widespread feeling that education was failing" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 2.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"not just in developing countries but also in so-called Western (or Northern) societies as well" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 2.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"By many non-formal education was seen as the ‘ideal’ form of education, far better in all respects than formal education." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 2.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"By others however, it came to be seen as a subsystem of education, certainly not superior and by some as considerably inferior to formal schooling" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 2.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Formal education as used here is, of course, the highly institutionalized, chronologically graded and hierarchically structured ‘education system’, spanning lower primary school and the upper reaches of the university (Coombs and Ahmed 1974:8)." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 3.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"… Nonformal education is any organized, systematic, educational activity carried on outside the framework of the formal system to provide selected types of learning to particular subgroups in the population, adults as well as children (Coombs and Ahmed 1974: 8)." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 3.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"every country interpreted non-formal education in their own way." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 3.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"There was a third element – informal education" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 4.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"They are really speaking about ‘informal learning’, not informal education" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 4.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"they define ‘education’ as planned and purposeful learning;  but they call ‘informal education’ all that learning that goes on outside of any planned learning situation – such as cultural events." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 4.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Informal education as used here is the lifelong process by which every person acquires and accumulates knowledge, skills, attitudes and insights from daily experiences and exposure to the environment –" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 4.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"informal education is unorganized and often unsystematic; yet it accounts for the great bulk of any person’s total lifetime learning" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 4.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"‘experiential learning’" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 4.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Nobody at this time defined informal education except in terms of unstructured learning" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 5.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"The non-formal education discourse divides the world of education into two, formal and non-formal, all of which is set inside a wider context of informal learning." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 5.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Non-formal education in the field: from the 1980s to today" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 5.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"From 1986 the debate about non-formal education (one of the most extensive in education’s history) declined" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 5.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"But during the 1980s and since then,  programmes labelled non-formal education have spread enormously throughout Third World countries" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 5.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Ethiopia is a prime example of this approach, with its national Directory of nonformal education." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 6.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"national development goals" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 6.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Non-formal education and lifelong learning/education" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 7.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Non-formal education and lifelong learning/education" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 7.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Since lifelong learning/education has itself been co-opted by the states to two main aims,  helping economic growth and promoting active citizenship, then the interest of the state and other agencies in non-formal education is with its contribution to these two ends" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 7.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Is open and distance learning part of formal or non-formal education? " (ROGERS, 2004, p. 8.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Secondly, the term non-formal education now covers a very wide continuum of educational programmes.  At one extreme lies the flexible schooling model – national or regional sub-systems of schools for children, youth and adults.  At the other extreme are the highly participatory educational programmes, hand-knitted education and training, tailor-made for each particular learning group, oneoff teaching events to meet particular localised needs. " (ROGERS, 2004, p. 8.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Most educational programmes will of course lie somewhere between these two points." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 8.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Towards a new paradigm" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 8.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Towards a new paradigm" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 8.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"This distinction is sometimes conceptualised in terms of contextualisation.  Some learning activities and teachinglearning materials are highly contextualised – chosen or created for this one learning group alone with considerable involvement of the learner group in the design of both curriculum and learning materials." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 8.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"self-directed or participatory education" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 8.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Other learning programmes are however less highly contextualised, with pre-set outcomes, a pre-set curriculum (however adapted it might be to the group), brought-in materials (which may again be adapted or supplemented by each participant group), and standardised forms of evaluation." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 9.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"group dynamics and organisational theory.  Groups can be located on a continuum from very formal to very informal. A formal group is one which does not change as new members join it. " (ROGERS, 2004, p. 9.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"An informal group is one which is highly dependent on the individual members, so that if someone joins or leaves,  the nature of the group and the activities it can undertake will also change." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 9.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Most groups of course lie somewhere in the middle and groups often move along the continuum in both directions." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 9.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"such a concept would help us to define formal as well as non-formal education" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 9.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"At the other extreme lies the educational programme or activity which is made up by the facilitator/teacher in association with the participants – a creative writing course or a reading circle, for example" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 10.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Most educational programmes of course lie somewhere between these two extremes. " (ROGERS, 2004, p. 10.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"This is what I would call flexible schooling – the standardised elements common to all such learning groups are clearly schooling but the participatory elements mean that it is schooling made flexible to the local group concerned." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 11.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"FORMAL FLEXIBLE PARTICIPATORY EDUCATION SCHOOLING EDUCATION" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 11.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"But unfortunately at the moment the term ‘non-formal education’ (that is everything that is not formal) is used to cover both flexible schooling and highly participatory education." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 11.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"FORMAL NON-FORMAL INFORMAL" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 11.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Non-formal then covers flexible schooling and informal education highly contextualised,  highly participatory educational activities." (ROGERS, 2004, p. 12.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"FORMAL NON-FORMAL PARTICIPATORY INFORMAL EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION LEARNING" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 12.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Informal learning here being all that incidental learning, unstructured, unpurposeful but the most extensive and most important part of all the learning that all of us do everyday of our lives" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 12.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Learning is the keystone;  it is the original matter out of which all education is created. " (ROGERS, 2004, p. 12.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Somewhere along the learning continuum,  we come to purposeful and assisted learning (education in its widest sense). " (ROGERS, 2004, p. 12.)</mark></br>

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Would such a reconceptualization of formal and non-formal (and informal) education help to sort out the confusion which undoubtedly exists?" (ROGERS, 2004, p. 13.)</mark></br>
