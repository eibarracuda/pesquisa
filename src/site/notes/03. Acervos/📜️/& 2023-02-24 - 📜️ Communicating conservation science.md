# Communicating conservation science

>> [!abstract]+ **Abstract**
>> "What are the key messages conservation science should communicate to the public? Although the profile of conservation science itself can be raised by talking about the process, most feel that the messages should concern what conservation science brings to the focus of its work – cultural heritage. However, it is no longer enough to focus on the needs of heritage in isolation. Demonstrating public benefit is crucial to persuade decision-makers to invest not only in the conservation of cultural heritage but also in the science that informs its care. Conservation science can research the significance of cultural heritage and how to enable access to it, but it now also needs to engage the public actively in its activities. This means continuing to use the traditional ‘hard’ sciences of physics and chemistry but also learning from and collaborating more with less familiar partners such as the social sciences, the medical sciences, and natural heritage to demonstrate how conservation science is good for people, and developing new methods of communication to do this. Conservation science needs to engage with the public not only as a subject for research but also as a means of doing the research, so the end also becomes the means. Public impact should be factored into conservation science projects, with training in communication and the principles of interpretation provided to those involved. A more fundamental shift may be required in the sector however, that puts people’s benefit at the heart of conservation science as much as the benefit of the cultural heritage it engages with."

In addition to providing understanding of deterioration processes and developing preservation treatments, conservation science can assist in understanding how heritage has changed over time, by revealing its history (technical art history), authenticating heritage assets, and informing conservation and presentation decisions such as cleaning techniques and levels. Conservation science can make connections between cultural heritage artefacts and history, such as identifying trade routes that shaped human society. The application of the social sciences and techniques such as demographics to the conservation science field of activity shows how people benefit from cultural heritage, what they themselves value about their heritage and how they wish to use it. New technologies can be investigated and developed by conservation science to communicate the significance and values of heritage to the public; for example, through digitization, scanning and computer modelling, giving alternative views, and virtual access where the original is too fragile or physically distant to be directly enjoyed.”</span></span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FAph0dTj8%2Fitems%2FCFY2QPVB%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Lithgow, 2015, p. 4</span>)</span>

Capability can be developed by engaging with interpretation and communication professionals, and participating in the communication programmes of the wider science community, but should also be built into training. Those involved in the work should become able to communicate effectively not only what conservation science discovers and the story of how it does this, but also to engage people in doing conservation science, and use that experience to enable understanding of conservation science beyond the exchange of information.”</span></span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2Flocal%2FAph0dTj8%2Fitems%2FCFY2QPVB%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D">(<span class="citation-item">Lithgow, 2015, p. 6</span>)</span>
